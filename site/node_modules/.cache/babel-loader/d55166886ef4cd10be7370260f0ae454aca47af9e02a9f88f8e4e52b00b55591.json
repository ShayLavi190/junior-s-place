But what are the shortcomings? Let’s consider some common disadvantages of AI tools.</p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>They are not as powerful as people intend to believe. They cannot create a fully-fledged website, e-commerce project, or unique solution that can be deployed to the web without any human intervention.</li>\n                <li>Mistakes happen. And they happen a lot. Do not be overconfident. You should not bet everything on AI tools because their outcomes can still be ambiguous and unexpected.</li>\n                <li>Running complex AI tools requires resources. This includes software and hardware. While in some cases, AI tools may provide cost-savings, when it comes to a general picture that covers complex situations and requires advanced solutions, it needs intensive energy capacities, which cause environmental damage.</li>\n                <li>AI tools lack the human ability to use emotion that, as a rule, stands behind creativity in the decision. Therefore, do not expect out-of-box solutions that cause a deep connection with the target audience.</li>\n                <li>They lack creativity as well. As the study shows, AI tools can create “novel” ideas but not original ones.</li>\n                <li>AI cannot make sensitive decisions. Humans naturally consider emotional ramifications, making more accurate decisions for particular groups.</li>\n                <li>AI tools can become outdated if not trained to learn and regularly revisited and evaluated by data scientists.</li>\n                <li>Consumer data privacy is a concern. New laws and regulations should be imposed to protect users from their data being replicated and used. This is also imperative to secure cross-border interactions because one country’s artificial intelligence policies may easily harm others.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <h2>Top 10 AI Tools for Web Developers to Try</h2>\n              <p>Let’s be honest; you will not find an AI tool to replace a web developer completely. Even brilliant website builders require human intervention to produce an outcome that meets the end user’s requirements, needs, and expectations. Do not expect AI tools to do everything. However, they can drastically simplify workflow, eliminate common human errors, increase security, improve product quality, save precious time, reduce stress, and give you more opportunities to be creative.</p>\n              <p><b>ChatGPT</b></p>\n              <img className = 'images3' src= {e1}/>\n              <p>We are going to start with <a href='https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt'>ChatGPT</a>.

Unlike Copilot, this one is intended to cover the basic needs of both web designers and developers. Its task is to convert a simple hand-drawn sketch into a working HTML boilerplate, skipping a vast stage in website building. Using AI, it offers creatives to share their thoughts via digital whiteboards. Then, it captures the images, runs them through its sophisticated AI model to detect patterns, and translates that understanding into HTML code. It efficiently detects a wide range of types of objects and produces a corresponding code snippet because it has been trained on millions of data sets. It may even predict the size and location of objects on the page. It undoubtedly makes mistakes; however, human intervention can easily mitigate and eliminate them. Web developers may benefit significantly from it. They may convert their ideas into HTML templates, generate a code snippet for a UI unit, and do other everyday chores within minutes.</p>\n              <h2>Appy Pie Website</h2>\n              <img className = 'images3' src= {e4}/>\n              <p>Although <a href='https://www.appypie.com/ai-website-builder'>Appy Pie</a> mainly targets citizen developers, those with coding skills and a wealth of experience may also enjoy its potential.
