If we want to call APIs with Axios from a vanilla JavaScript application, then we need to include it from a Content delivery network (CDN) as shown here: <b>&lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</b></p>\n              <h2>Sending Requests with the Axios Instance</h2>\n              <p>Let us start by invoking a GET method with the Axios HTTP client from our server-side application: serversideapp. For doing this, we will add an Express route handler function with a URL: /products to the application. In the route handler function, we will fetch the list of products by calling an API from our apiserver with the URL: http://localhost:3002/products. We will use the signature: axios(config) on the default instance provided by the Axios HTTP client for doing this:</p>\n              <img className = 'images3' src= {e2}/>\n              <p>In this example, we are first calling require('axios') for getting an instance: axios set up with a default configuration. Then we are passing a configuration argument to the axios instance containing the method parameter set to the HTTP method: get and the url parameter set to the URL of the REST endpoint: http://localhost:3002/products. The url parameter is mandatory while we can omit the method parameter that will then default to get. This method returns a JavaScript Promise object which means the program does not wait for the method to complete before trying to execute the subsequent statement. The Promise is either fulfilled or rejected, depending on the response from the API. We use the then() method as in this example for processing the result. The then() method gets executed when the Promise is fulfilled . In our example, in the then method, we are extracting the list of products by calling apiResponse.data. Similarly, a POST request for adding a new product made with the axios default instance will look like this:</p>\n              <img className = 'images3' src= {e3}/>\n              <p>In this example, in addition to what we did for calling the GET method, we have set the data element containing the JSON representation of the new Product along with an Authorization header. We are processing the response in the then function on the Promise response where we are extracting the API response data by calling apiResponse.data. For more involved processing of the API response, it will be worthwhile to understand all the elements of the response returned by the API call made with axios : </p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>data: Response payload sent by the server</li>\n                <li>status: HTTP status code from the server response</li>\n                <li>statusText: HTTP status message from the server response</li>\n                <li>headers: HTTP headers received in the API response</li>\n                <li>config: config sent to the axios instance for sending the request</li>\n                <li>request: Request that generated this response. It is the last ClientRequest instance in node.js (in redirects) and an XMLHttpRequest instance in the browser.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <h2>Sending Requests with the Convenience Instance Methods of Axios</h2>\n              <p>Axios also provides an alternate signature for making the API calls by providing convenience methods for all the HTTP methods like:axios.get(), axios.post(), axios.put(), axios.delete(), etc. We can write the previous example for calling the GET method of the REST API using the convenience method: axios.get() as shown below:</p>\n              <img className = 'images3' src= {e4}/>\n              <h2>In this example, in the Express route handler function, we are calling the get() method on the default instance of axios and passing the URL of the REST API endpoint as the sole argument. This code looks much more concise than the signature: axios(config) used in the example in the previous section. The signature: axios.get() is always preferable for calling the REST APIs due to its cleaner syntax. However, the signature: axios(config) of passing a config object containing the HTTP method, and URL parameters to the axios instance can be used in situations where we want to construct the API calls dynamically. The get() method returns a JavaScript Promise object similar to our earlier examples, where we extract the list of products inside the then function. Instead of appending the request query parameter in the URL in the previous example, we could have passed the request parameter in a separate method argument: params as shown below:</h2>\n
